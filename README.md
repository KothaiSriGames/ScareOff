In "Scare off", you are trapped in a mysterious off-world arena, relentlessly hunted by an intelligent alien entity. Your only hope of survival is to outsmart the AI and collect all the scattered power gems across the level. Once collected, these gems activate a dimensional portal that allows you to escape to the next stage. But bewareâ€”the alien learns and adapts to your moves. Every moment counts, every corner can be a trap.
